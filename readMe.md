<h1>Check Yo' Self</h1>
<p>The Check Yo'Self project is the final solo project for Module 1 during my time at Turing.  Its my way of showing off what I've learned during my first 6 weeks of school.  Some of the material covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML</li>
<li>BEM naming conventions</li>
<li>Organized CSS</li>
<li>BEM CSS styling</li>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
<li>Media Queries</li>
<li>Event Bubbling</li>
<li>Array Prototypes</li>
<li>ES6 arrow functions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>This project was important for me becuase it shows what I can do without a team of people to help.  It shows my problem solving skills and how DRY my code is.  During group projects its hard to tell where each person is at with each particular skill, but now its evident what my strengths and weekness' are and where I can improve going into Module 2</p>
